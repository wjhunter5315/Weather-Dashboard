weather api homework

Enter a City into the input field and click the button.
See a Current Weather status as well as a 5 day forecast.

I used some bootstrap for the bsic layout.
Most of the elements are dynamically generated with JS.
I understand how to use the API fairly well, im using 3 calls in one function.
I currently do not have Moment.js on here, and I need some work with localStorage use.
I also couldn't get the UV index color to change.
